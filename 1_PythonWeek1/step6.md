# .py files
You now know the very basics of Python, hurray! *But how do I write and run Python code outside this course?*

# Let's explain the File Editor and Terminal on Katacoda
**Terminal**<br>
The Terminal is like the Command Prompt on your Windows computer. Using that, you can do everything that you can achieve via mouse and keyboard and more, from creating folders to changing computer settings.

Katacoda has Python pre-installed within the system which allows us to run ```python week1.py```. What that does is ask the installed Python module to run a file called *week1.py*.

**File Editor**<br>
The File Editor is a bit like your computer. You can have folders and then files inside of those folders. These files are just like files on your computer - images, videos etc. Pictures might be named ```dog.png``` or ```cutebunnies.jpg``` for example, while we name Python files as ```example.py```. Python files are essentially text files, and we simply name the file extensions as ```.py``` so that programmes know it's a Python file.
