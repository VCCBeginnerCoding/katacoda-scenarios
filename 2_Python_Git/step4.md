# Bringing it all together
Now that we have had some practice with Git commands and gained a basic level of familiarity with them, it's time to put them into practice to solidify wht you've already learned.

You're going to get some code that works but needs editing, and you're going to create you're own repo and manage these changes in this repo. For the purposes of time, we will stick to using the GitHub website for now but feel free to try this in the command line in your own time!
