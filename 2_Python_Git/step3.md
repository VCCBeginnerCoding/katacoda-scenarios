# Branching

The concept of branching is very important in Git version control. when you create a repository, a default branch called "main" is created. On this branch, you should only have working verisons of your code on the main branch.
Any time you want to work on a new feature or bug fix, you should create a new branch which has a name that reflects what you're working on. This is to prevent any new changes to your code creating new bugs in your main branch.
