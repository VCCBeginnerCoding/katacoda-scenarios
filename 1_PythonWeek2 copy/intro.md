## Python Module 1
Why have we chosen python to learn? Python's easy syntax (i.e. its readability) doesn't only make it easy to learn; it also makes Python an excellent 'gateway' language. As a highly abstract language, it is very intuitive for new learners as it allows you to focus less on the code and more on the programming concepts themselves.

Remember: Don't hesistate to ask for help or Google for support whenever you're stuck. Being a programmer means knowing how to find stuff on the internet. Throughout the course we'll also be linking to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) for more information.
