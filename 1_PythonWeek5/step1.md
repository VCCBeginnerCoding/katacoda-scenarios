# Intro to Classes
This section will introduce you to what a class is, why they are used and how they are structured. <br>
Also see below for the skills that you will obtain at the end of this course.
<br><br>

## Object-Oriented Programming and Classes
Before we cover classes, it is important to first understand what object-oriented programming is. 
<br><br>
<b>Definition:</b> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
<br><br>
The structure of OOP then includes:
<ul>
  <li><b>Classes</b> are user-defined blueprints for objects, attributes and methods</li>
  <li><b>Objects</b> are instances of a class with specific data relating to a real-world item or abstract entity</li>
  <li><b>Methods</b> are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviours of an object</li>
  <li><b>Attributes/Properties</b> represent the state of an object and store its data</li>
 </ul>
 
 To better understand the structure of OOP, see the image below that uses the example of someone sending an email:

## Why Use Classes?
Classes are useful because they allow you to keep track of objects you create.<br>You can easily store the basic components and adjust them; this ultimately reduces the amount of code you have to write and allows other people to better understand your code. This is absolutely vital in a working environment.
