# Intro to Classes
This section will introduce you to what a class is, why they are used and how they are structured. <br>
Also see below for the skills that you will obtain at the end of this course.
<br>

## What Are Classes?
<b>Definition:</b> In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values, and implementations of behavior. The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.
<br><br>
There are many examples to what an object can be, your imagination is the limit! To help better understad, see the image below.

  Classes are useful because they allow you too keep track of objects you create.<br>You can easily store the basic components and adjust them; this ultimately reduces 
  the amount of code you have to write and allows other people to better understand your code. This is absolutely vital in a working environment. <br>Even 
  outside of work, when creating certain applications/games, using classes makes your code cleaner and easier to understand when returning to it after a longer period
  of time.

<br>

## Overall Structure
The basic components to a class are its attributes and methods.
