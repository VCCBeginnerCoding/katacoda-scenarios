## DIY: Creating an advanced program
Have a go at creating a more complicated class. Choose one of the scenarios below and have a go! You can make this as simple or as advanced as you'd like, use this as a chance to practice some things you've learnt over the course!

**Scenario 1:** Use the class you previously created for a car. Add in more attributes (such as colour, mileage, price...) and some extra methods that a car dealership might find useful (eg. printing off a list of details, crrating a list of all the objects and finding a particular one...).

**Scenario 2:** Mmmmmm. I don't know about you but I love ice cream! I'd love to use an automatic register but I have no way of keeping track of all of my customers and products! I have all the classics you see, and they love them. Some are regulars that I give special discounts to so I'm scared of switching to an automatic system that logs who my customers are and what they are eating as it's important to me that they still recieve my special treatment! Can you help me?

I would like a system that stores a customer's name, number of products bought and total spending. I need to give each customer the option for a receipt. I have many products you'll easily find online. My special treatment customers are Roxanne, Jinx, Jamal and litty Trixy. But I consider any customer who spends more than Â£30 a week a special treatment customer.
