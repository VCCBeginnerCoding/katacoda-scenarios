You are going to create classes for a pokedex. Once your code is finished the user should be able to view details of a pokemon that they choose. They should also be able to pick a pokemon to be their partner (they are only allowed one). At any point they can also view who their partner is, any previous partners that they have had and the number of times they've released a pokemon.

**Note:** Every the user picks a new partner. If they already have one, that partner is released.

Are you up for the challenge?
