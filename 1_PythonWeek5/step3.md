Using the image we saw in step 1, we want you to try and create your own class based off the structure shown:

</p>
<br>

This means you should:
<ol>
  <li>Create a class called Human</li><br>
  
  <li>Give it a constructor with attributes/properties email and address (a second email of the recipient)</li><br>
  
  <li>Add in the methods verify and sendMail. These can contain any code you like, but on a basic level have a print statement</li><br>
  
  <li>Create three objects called name1, name2 and name3, and pass in different emails and addresses</li><br>
  
  <li>Use these objects to print off the unique attributes and execute any code you have written</li><br>
  
</ol>
