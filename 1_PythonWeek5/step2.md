## Classes and attributes
Attributes are the variables you define for every obeject. In other words, ever object that you create from a class will adopt those variables. The values for the variables are not constant for each object.

**For example:**
```
# defining code for a class
class className():
  # variables associated for this class
  name = "default"
  number = 0
  
```{{copy}}

<br>

## Classes and methods
Methods are functions you define for every obeject. In other words, ever object that you create from a class will adopt those functions. 

**For example:**
<pre class="file" data-filename="classEx2.py" data-target="replace">

# defining code for a class
class className():
    # method for this class - self represents the object that is calling the method (this will be explored more in the next section)
    def sum(self, int1, int2):
        return int1 + int2

</pre>

`python classEx2.py`{{execute}}

# DIY: Create your own class
Have a go at creating your own class with attributes and methods. If you like, you can use the scenario below for inspiration.

**Scenario:**
Define a class for a car. Think of all of the features a car has for the attributes (model, colour etc.) and any method calculations (accelaration, tax etc.) you could perform.
