# while
```
while there is something to do
    do it
```

As you can see, `while`{{}} and `if`{{}} work similarly.

Create and open new Python file: `loops.py` and for each example paste in the code to the file

<pre class="file" data-filename="loops.py" data-target="replace">
# Store the current largest number here.
largest_number = -999999999

# Input the first value.
number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to stop: "))

# If the number is not equal to -1, continue.
while number != -1:
    # Is number larger than largest_number?
    if number > largest_number:
        # Yes, update largest_number.
        largest_number = number
    # Input the next number.
    number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to stop: "))

# Print the largest number.
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
</pre>

`python loops.py`{{execute}}

If you're stuck in an infinite loop and want it to stop you can press <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>CONTROL</kbd><kbd> BREAK</kbd> or <kbd>COMMAND</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> depending on your computer.

# for

Try to guess what this does before running it.

<pre class="file" data-filename="loops.py" data-target="replace">
for i in range(10):
    print("The value of i is currently", i)
</pre>

`python loops.py`{{execute}}

<pre class="file" data-filename="loops.py" data-target="replace">
# start at 2, stop BEFORE 8
for i in range(2, 8):
    print("The value of i is currently", i)
</pre>

`python loops.py`{{execute}}

<pre class="file" data-filename="loops.py" data-target="replace">
# start at 2, stop BEFORE 30, increase in increments of 3
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
    print(x)
</pre>

`python loops.py`{{execute}}

# break

Once you've found what you're looking for you don't have to keep the function running. There's where `break`{{}} comes in.

<pre class="file" data-filename="loops.py" data-target="replace">
# Exit the loop when x is "banana":
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    print(x)
    if x == "banana":
        break
</pre>

`python loops.py`{{execute}}

# continue

With `continue` we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next.

<pre class="file" data-filename="loops.py" data-target="replace">
# Do not print banana
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    if x == "banana":
        continue
    print(x)
</pre>

`python loops.py`{{execute}}
