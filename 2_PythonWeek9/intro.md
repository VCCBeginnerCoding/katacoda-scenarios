# Welcome to Vodafone Coding Club - Crash Course
## Additional Challenge
This session will cover using our skills in python to create a basic user-friendly application with streamlit. Killercode doesn't support this so you will need to download a python IDE on your local machine. 

This course will cover some basic concepts but there are far more features that can be done through streamlit. It will mainly cover using python to automatically modify a PowerPoint and to do using an Excel File.
