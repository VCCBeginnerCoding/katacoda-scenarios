Messy Terminal? `clear`{{execute}} it.
<hr>

You've learnt the basics of If and Else statements now, so lets see if you can write one yourself.

## **Exercise 1:**
Ask user to enter a number, if the number is less than 10, print “Number is too high!”.

To write your own code simply create a new Python file called: `ifexercise1.py`

Write your code in the editor that has now opened and when you are ready, execute it with
`python ifexercise1.py`{{execute}}

## **Exercise 2:**
Ask user to enter a password.  If the password is “PASSWORD”, print “Login successful”.  If not, print “Incorrect password!”

## **Exercise 3:**
Ask user to enter a name.  If name is “Tom”, print “Welcome Tom!”, if not, print “Sorry <name>, we are expecting Tom.”

## **Exercise 4:**
Ask user to enter 2 numbers.  If the number is the same, print “SNAP”.
* Added challenge – if the first number is higher, print “Your first number is higher than the second number”, else print “Your second number is higher than the first number”

## **Exercise 5:**
Ask user to enter 3 numbers.  Print “SNAP” if all 3 numbers are the same.
* Added challenge – print the smallest number if they are not the same.

## **Exercise 6:**
Write a program that uses If, else and elif statements to tell the user it wants a certain number as input. Below is a list of things the program should do:
- print the sentence "No, I want a bigger number!" on the screen if the inputted number is less than 5
- print the sentence "This number is too big!" on the screen if the inputted number is greater than 10
- print the sentence "This number is just right!" on the screen if the inputted number is 7
- otherwise, print the sentence "This number is close, but still not right!" on the screen

## **Exercise 7:**
Write a program for the following:
* Three friends have been collecting money for charity.
* A local company has offered to double the amount of money they collect if they raise over £1000.
* Write a program that allows the friends to enter their individual amounts.
* The program should then add the three amounts and store the total.
* If the total is greater or equal to 1000, the total should be doubled.
* Finally the total should be displayed.
