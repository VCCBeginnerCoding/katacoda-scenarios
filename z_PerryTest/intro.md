# Welcome to Vodafone Coding Club - Crash Course
## Python Week 2
This week we will be going into more depth and exploring if/else statements (conditional statements) and Lists. 

As a quick recap, below are some videos of the subjects we covered last week, just to refresh some of the learning you did.

For this video we only covered the first 14 minutes of it in the previous session, so you do not have to watch the full video since it is quite long.

Remember: If you are struggling with any of the concepts please let an instructor know or ask in the teams chat for help. Google is also a great resource for when you're stuck.
