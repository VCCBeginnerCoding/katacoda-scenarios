# Writing your own code
Hover over the code snippets below and click *Copy to Editor* to copy the code to a Python file in your editor (top right).

Messy Terminal? `clear`{{execute}} it.

<hr>

Now that you have managed to copy over some code, why not have a go at writing your own. In the text file write the code to print out <span style="color:green">your name(</span> to the console.


Once you have written the code press
`python week0.py`{{execute}}. You can also type `python week0.py` yourself via the terminal (bottom right) and then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute it.


# What Should Happen
You should see your name print in your terminal. You have written your first code!
