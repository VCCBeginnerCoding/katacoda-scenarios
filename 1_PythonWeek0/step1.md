# Basics

First, you must create a Python file in the editor to be able to run code. To do this, simply click the "editor" tab, right click on a blank space in that tab and select "new file" (or click Alt+N). With this information, create a file called "week0.py".

You can click the code snippets below to copy the code to a Python file in your editor (top right).

Messy Terminal? Type in `clear` in the terminal to clean it.

The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device `print()`.

`print("Hello World")`{{copy}}

Copy the code above over to the editor and then type in 
`python week0.py`{{exec}}. You can also type <span style="color:blue">'python week0.py'</span> yourself via the Terminal (bottom right) and then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute it.


# What Should Happen
You should see hello world print in your terminal. You have run your first piece of code!
