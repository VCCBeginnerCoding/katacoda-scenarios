# Welcome to Vodafone Coding Club - Crash Course
## Python Week 0
This week we will be learning the katacoda IDE to make sure you are familiar with it and are set up for the first learning session next time.

We will go through all the steps to get the code running for yourself.

Please note: The user needs to copy to editor and then press the python execute script button for each code block!
